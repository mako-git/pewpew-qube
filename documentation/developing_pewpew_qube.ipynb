    "<a href=\"https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-camp-europe-19/issues/62\">PewPew Qube</a> is a quantum adaption of the famous Rubik's cube to the PewPew handheld console. \n",
    "It has been developed at the <a href=\"https://qiskit.camp/europe/\">Qiskit Camp Europe</a> hackathon in September 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the goal is to transform a random initial state to a well-defined final state. \n",
    "For a Rubik's cube, this is done by rotating the six sides of a multi-colored cube until all sides of the cube uniformly colored.\n",
    "For the PewPew Qube game, the player applies quantum gates to the state vector of a two-qubit system. \n",
    "These gates rotate the state vector around various directions on the two-qubit Bloch-(hyper)sphere.\n",
    "The goal is to reach a specific target state.\n",
    "A more detailed explanation of the game and hints how to solve it are given <a href=\"./documentation.ipynb\">here</a>.\n",
